After last year’s launch of the AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE) @ICAI collaboration, we are excited to announce that our team of 16 comprising of PhD researchers, Master and Bachelor students is now complete and operational.

We celebrated this major milestone with a hands-on workshop at the beautiful @royaldelft. 
AI4SE is a pioneering collaboration between Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and JetBrains Research, dedicated to advancing AI-driven innovation in software engineering and transforming the developer experience. Through five tracks, we focus on AI-driven code generation, optimizing LLMs for coding, enhancing IDE productivity with LLMs, leveraging runtime data for performance, and developing AI-powered teaching assistants for programming.

Together, JetBrains Research and the Software Engineering Research Group at TU Delft aim to redefine how software is built, tested, and taught—paving the way for smarter, more efficient engineering solutions. If you want to join the collaboration as a Bachelor or Master student, please reach out to Dr. Maliheh Izadi.
