We are proud to announce that the tutorial on _Creating in-IDE Programming Courses_ has been accepted at the SIGCSE 2025 Technical Symposium, held in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in February 2025.

**Abstract:**  

_The in-IDE learning format represents a novel way of teaching programming to students entirely within an industry-grade IDE, allowing them to learn both the language and the necessary tooling at the same time. In this tutorial, we will teach the audience everything they need to know to create in-IDE courses and analyze how the students are working in them. In the first part of the tutorial, the audience will get to know the JetBrains Academy plugin that allows creating courses for IntelliJ-based IDEs such as IDEA and PyCharm. The participants will develop their own simple courses with theory, programming tasks, and quizzes, as well as employ some LLM-based features like automatic test generation. In the second part, we will learn how to use the TaskTracker plugin to collect the code snapshots and the usage of IDE features of students when solving the tasks. Finally, the participants will solve tasks in their own course while collecting the data using TaskTracker, and we will show them how to process and analyze the collected data. As the outcome of the tutorial, the audience will know how to create in-IDE courses, track the studentsâ€™ performance and analyze it, and will already have their own simple course and a dataset that can be expanded or used for further research._
