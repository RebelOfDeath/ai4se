From April 15-21, the flagship ACM/IEEE International Conference in Software Engineering ([ICSE 2024][ICSE]) took place in Lisbon, Portugal.
Researchers from both JetBrains and TU Delft were prominently present at this conference and its co-located events (just search for JetBrains or Delft in the [program], and you'll find dozens of entries).

Joint JetBrains / TU Delft work included:

- The jointly organized [tool competition][sbft] at Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT).
- The tool demonstration and tutorial of [TestSpark], a plugin for generating unit tests that natively integrates different AI-based test generation tools and techniques in the IDE ([paper][testspark-paper]).
- A literature survey on in-IDE human-AI experience in the era of large language models, presented at the [IDE workshop][ide workshop] ([arxiv link][arxiv-in-ide]).

Other notable events directly relevant to AI4SE include:

- The first edition of the [IDE Workshop], which attracted over 50 participants with a highly interactive discussion-focused format.
- The keynote by [Nikita Koval] from JetBrains at the [IDE Workshop] on concurrency testing in the IDE.
- The ICSE research track paper providing a practical evaluation of large language models for code, based on the [code4me] (IntelliJ and VS Code) plugins ([arxiv][arxiv-code4me]).
- The presentation of a (negative) result on code readability and large language models, presented at the International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC) ([arxiv][arxiv-icpc]).

Lastly, on ICSE's Friday around 15 AI4SE members and researchers from JetBrains and TU Delft met for a group meeting and dinner in the beautiful city of Lisbon.
